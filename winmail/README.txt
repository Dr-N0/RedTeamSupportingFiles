Purpose of the script is to change the keyboard language of the console on a timer. This will distract blue team,
although it is not designed to completely prevent them from functioning.

First download the .vbs and .bat files to the C:\Program Files\Windows Mail folder. The files are named to fit in
with the files in this specific folder.

To run:
Run the .vbs file by double clicking it in the library. This file will run the script contained in the .bat
file without opening a command prompt.

The .bat file changes the language to english first, then to hebrew, then english, french, and english again.
Total time is 16 min, with 10 min on the english setting and 6 min on the foreign languages.
