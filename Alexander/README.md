Nothing to see here


xd.sh creates a new hidden directory for a safe place to rename the specified commands: “find,” “kill,” “pkill,” and “history.”
It then changes the command names, all ending in "_wrapper."

hehe.sh checks "echo $PATH" for everywhere there is a bin directory to then rename the specified commands: “find,” “kill,” 
“pkill,” and “history.” This is in case xd.sh does not work. "echo $PATH" lists everywhere there are bin directories, spearated 
by a ":" which is written into the script.
